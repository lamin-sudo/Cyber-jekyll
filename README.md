## Known Issues & Required Fixes

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: The button's appearance changes, but the theme itself does not switch. This might be an issue with the theme being used.
- **Page Design**: Improve the design of the "About Me" and "Contact Me" pages to match the main homepage layout.
- **Preference Persistence**: Add support for saving the dark/light mode preference in `localStorage` to persist settings between page reloads.
